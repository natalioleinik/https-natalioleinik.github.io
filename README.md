# mentally-strong


The website is aimed to provide mental health resources, advocate for mental health and PTSD programs and ensure that therapies are provided at no cost for veterans.
The issue of mental health across veterans has always been important to me.
I grew up listening to stories of veterans through literature, history books and family stories.
Last year, in my English class, I read DAGON by H.P. LOVECRAFT . H. P. Lovecraft, in his short story, reveals the suffering that the war victims and soldiers encounter after returning to everyday life without bombings and mental destruction. After finishing the book, I started researching more about the issue, and due to the context of Russian-Ukrainian war, I felt that my duty as a world citizen is to advocate for well-being of veterans and soldiers, and people around the world who faced war.
