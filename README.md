# mentally-strong


The website is aimed to provide mental health resources, advocate for mental health and PTSD programs and ensure that therapies are provided at no cost for veterans.
The issue of mental health across veterans has always been important to me.
I grew up listening to stories of veterans through literature, history books and family stories.
Therefore, I was very excited to make this website!!
