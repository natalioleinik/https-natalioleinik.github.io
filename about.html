<!--  text about me   -->
    <p  class = "aboutText">Thank you for visiting my website. I am <mark style="background-color:#bbbfbd;"> a high school student in United States, who grew up in Belarus </mark>. The issue of mental health across veterans has always been important to me. I grew up listening to stories of veterans through literature, history books and family stories. Last year, in my English class, I read <mark style="background-color:#bbbfbd;">DAGON by H.P. LOVECRAFT </mark>. H. P. Lovecraft, in his short story, <mark style="background-color:#bbbfbd;"> reveals the suffering that the war victims and soldiers encounter </mark> after returning to everyday life without bombings and mental destruction. Despite the unknowns and reliability of the plot of "Dagon," the reader supposes that the narrator is a returning soldier in 1917 who gets horrible nightmares that include large absurd fish swimming around him in the open water. The main character feels terrified and lost in the nightmares caused by PTSD, as it is a prevalent symptom. As a coping mechanism, the character decides to take the path of substance abuse and, later, suicide. <mark style="background-color:#bbbfbd;"> After finishing the book, I started researching more about the issue, and due to the context of Russian-Ukrainian war, I felt that my duty as a world citizen is to advocate for well-being of the Ukrainian soldiers, and people around the world who faced war. </mark>  </p>
